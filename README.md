# Image Blending with ROI Masking

This project focuses on image blending by using thresholding and bitwise operations to create a mask for region-of-interest (ROI) extraction, resulting in seamless blending of images. This technique is particularly useful for compositing images, where one image can be blended into specific regions of another image smoothly.

## Overview

Image blending allows for the combination of multiple images, where specific regions of one image are overlaid onto another. By creating a mask through thresholding and applying bitwise operations, we can isolate the ROI and blend images seamlessly.

## Features

- **ROI Extraction**: Select a region of interest from one image for blending.
- **Seamless Blending**: Use thresholding and bitwise operations to blend images without hard edges.
- **Mask Creation**: Easily control the blending area using a mask for precise compositing.
